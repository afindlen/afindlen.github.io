    		<p> On March 2, 2019, my high school basketball team was able to accomplish something that hadn't been done in our school for exactly 50 years; winning a state championship in basketball. </p>

    		<p>Here is an article that was written in the Bangor Daily News about us: <A HREF="https://bangordailynews.com/2019/03/02/sports/tourney-time/caribou-outlasts-cape-elizabeth-in-double-overtime-for-first-state-crown-since-69/"> Caribou boys outlast Cape Elizabeth for first state crown since 1969 </A></p>

    		<p>Here is another link to an interesting video about the State Championship made by Caribou alumni Ben Ezzy: <A HREF="https://vimeo.com/321025857"> Small Town, Big Dreams </A></p>

    		<p> For me, winning the State Championship had a deeper meaning. It was fulfilling a promise that I had made to my Grandfather. This is an article in the Bangor Daily News that talks about it: <A HREF="https://bangordailynews.com/2019/03/05/sports/tourney-time/for-caribou-senior-state-championship-victory-is-a-pledge-fulfilled/"> How a Caribou senior basketball player fulfilled a promise to his dying grandfather </A></p>
