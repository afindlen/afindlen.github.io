        <h2> Reselling Shoes and Hyped Clothing</h2></center>
        <p> Since my Sophomore year in high school, I have been reselling shoes and clothing that are extremely sought after. These shoes/clothes are available to purchase on certain retailer sites, but sell out in seconds, instantly having a resell value. I started out by just using my phone to try and buy the shoes off the websites and now I have computer programs called bots that are able to get multiple pairs at a time. The best shoe I have bought and resold are the Travis Scott Air Jordan One Lows. I bought this shoe for $160 and sold them as soon as I recieved them for $710. Below is a picture of this shoe.</p>

        <p> I have had great success with this business, selling on multiple platforms. This business is something that I hope to continue to work on and expand in the future. </p>
